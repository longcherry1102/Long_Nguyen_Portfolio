service: Market Analysis, Product Strategy
client: Bonnie Plants
shortDescription: Bonnie Plants, a leading live goods provider, aimed to capture the growing houseplant market to connect with younger, urban consumers and increase brand awareness. Our team developed a strategic marketing plan to position Bonnie as a key player in the wellness-driven houseplant category.
challenge: Bonnie Plants wanted to expand its portfolio into the houseplant market to appeal to younger audiences, many of whom are driven by wellness trends and consider themselves “plant parents.” The challenge was to identify key consumers, create unique product offerings, and establish a strong presence in this competitive market.
solution: We proposed the launch of “Bonnie Better 4 You” houseplant bundles, focusing on mental and physical wellness. The bundles were designed to include small-to-medium houseplants, such as aloe, lavender, and spider plants, which provide health benefits like stress reduction and air purification. We recommended a dual retail approach leveraging eCommerce platforms like Amazon and BonniePlants.com, along with partnerships with major retailers such as Target and Home Depot. A targeted media campaign featured TikTok and Instagram micro-influencers to resonate with the 18–44 age group, driving engagement through quizzes and interactive content.
