service: Market Research, Strategic Planning
client: Mike's Hard Lemonade
shortDescription: Mike’s Hard Lemonade is a leading beverage brand known for its unique flavor and vibrant personality. My role in this project focused on identifying market opportunities, optimizing strategies, and supporting the brand's growth in competitive segments.
challenge: Mike’s Hard Lemonade struggled to regain relevance among 21+ customers and lacked association with any specific drinking occasion. The brand needed a fresh approach to re-engage its audience and carve out a unique space in the competitive beverage market.
solution: To address this challenge, I developed a strategic campaign promoting Mike’s Hard Lemonade Zero Sugar during the tailgate football season. By aligning the brand with a beloved social occasion and highlighting the zero-sugar offering, the campaign appealed to health-conscious consumers while embracing the spirit of football season.
