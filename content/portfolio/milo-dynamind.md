client: Nestlé
shortDescription: Nestlé challenged teams to develop a strategy for introducing Milo Dynamind, a new product designed to capture a unique market segment. The goal was to create an entirely new consumption occasion that aligned with the product's core benefits.
challenge: Nestlé sought to position Milo Dynamind as a staple in the lives of students while establishing a new consumption occasion. The challenge was to identify a time in their daily routine where the product would naturally fit, creating a unique habit among the target audience.
solution: Our team proposed targeting the after-school break period, a critical time when students need a quick, nutritious snack before heading to afternoon extra classes. We crafted a campaign positioning Milo Dynamind as the perfect companion to satisfy hunger and provide energy during this transitional period. The solution emphasized pairing Milo Dynamind with light snacks to create a simple, fulfilling routine. This strategy not only introduced a unique consumption occasion but also resonated with students and parents, aligning with their lifestyle and nutritional needs.
